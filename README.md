# Backend Challenge

## Description

This project is a scalable backend application built with NestJS, developed as a solution for a backend challenge. It provides a RESTful API to manage users and integrates with an external Dragon Ball API to enrich user profiles with character data based on their matching Dragon Ball IDs.

Built with Clean Architecture principles in mind, the application ensures high maintainability and testability. It leverages TypeORM and PostgreSQL for robust data persistence, and is fully containerized with Docker to provide a seamless development and deployment experience. Additionally, the project includes automated CI/CD pipelines via CircleCI and comprehensive E2E testing to guarantee code reliability.

## Areas to imporve 

- A hash must be generated for the password.
- Deployment could be done.

## Techs

- Nest: 11.0.16
- Node: 22.14.0
- TypeORM
- Postgres

## Decision made

- Clean Architecture: To be able to handle further changes in the future in a proper way.
- TypeORM: Because it is the already integrated ORM in the Nest Framework and it is the most popular ORM so it is easy to find fixes and people that know how to use it.
- Docker: To make portable.
- Jest/Testing/E2E: Jest is the most used testing framework of JS. Same argument as above. E2E testing was done because it is useless to always test every single part. That's why if the controller provide the proper answer the test has passed.
- CircleCI: To automate the testing process and the deployment process.
- Coveralls: To automate the coverage process.
